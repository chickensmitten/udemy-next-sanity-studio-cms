## Getting started
- for documentation, head to [sanity.io/docs](https://sanity.io/docs)
- Iamge upload sizes are limited. Need to ask user to upload smaller file.
- `npm install --save @sanity/code-input`
- `sanity install @sanity/production-preview`
- when deploying, ensure that sanity cli version in this studio matches with the blog `"@sanity/cli": "^2.35.2"`
- when running `npm build`, ensure the script is also like this `"build": "sanity build dist -y"`
